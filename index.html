  My experience so far with web design and development is 1 and a half years in community college studying. This is where I have learned the most of my knowledge from, however back in high school I did take some web designing classes that helped peak my interest in this field. On top of that, I used to mess around in JavaScript reversing code from open source plugins for a game called Minecraft to learn what the code does. These 2 things is what initially sparked my interest in web design and development.

  What I hope to learn
</h3>
  
<p class="para2">
  I hope to continue to expand my knowledge from this course, I believe this will be the most advanced web design and development course I have taken so far. I am excited to get more advanced, however I know it will not be easy. I am not the greatest at remember information so I usually struggle and go over everything I learn multiple times to finally get it down. My hope is to learn new things about developing despite how hard it may be, I am motivated to do my best.

  <h3>
    My Future
  </h3>

  <p class="para3">
     In the future I hope to be able to be using this knowledge in my job career every day. Outside of this field I don't really know what I would do, so I am hoping to retain my knowledge and apply it over to the real world by working in this field for my future career. I sometimes get bored and mess around with developing stuff in my free time just for practice so I will definitely be using it for that. I could also teach my friends a thing or two about web design as I have a few friends that might be interested in the field.
